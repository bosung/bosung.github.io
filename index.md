I'm a researcher in Natural Language Processing lab at Sungkyunkwan University and I'm working with Prof. Youngjoong Ko. Prior to SKKU, I received B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at Sogang University. After undergraduate, I worked at Coupang as a software engineer for 2 years.

My research interests are knowledge graph representation and knowledge-aware models. I am also interested in multilingual NLP for low-resource languages.
