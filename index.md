Hi!👋 

I'm a third-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego.

My research focuses on natural language processing and generative AI. I am particularly interested in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-world applications and extracting knowledge from transformer and state space model based LLMs. I'm also keen on enhancing the textual capabilities of multimodal models, especially in text-to-image generation models.

Before UCSD, I worked as a software engineer on the Query Understanding team at [Coupang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupang) (the largest e-commerce company in Korea), developing recommendation systems using large-scale user behavior data and product descriptions. I hold a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Sogang University.
