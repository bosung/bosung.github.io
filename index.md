Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego, and I'm working with Prof. Ndapa Nakashole.

My research interests are knowledge graph representation and knowledge-aware models. I am also interested in multilingual NLP for low-resource languages.

Prior to UCSD, I worked as a researcher in Natural Language Processing lab at the Sungkyunkwan University with Prof. Youngjoong Ko. I received B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at the Sogang University. After my undergraduate, I worked at Coupang as a software engineer for 2 years.
