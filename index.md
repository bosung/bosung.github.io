I'm a second-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego working with Professor [Ndapa Nakashole](ndapa.us).

My research centers on natural language processing, especially I’m focusing on weakly supervised learning and its interpretability, and joint learning methods for entity retrieval using autoregressive generation models. I’m also interested in knowledge graph representations and the use of graph-structured data for various NLP applications.

Prior to UCSD, I worked as a researcher in Natural Language Processing lab at Sungkyunkwan University with Prof. Youngjoong Ko. I received B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at Sogang University. After my undergraduate, I worked at Coupang as a software engineer.
